# PossibleGame
Could become a game - inspired by Subway Surfer

Ok someone suggested my "big" project in C should be a game, but I don't really know how to do that? 
This works as a game if you run it in your command prompt but I don't really know how to do graphics or anything.
I am looking into learning but I thought I'd put it up because it miraculously actually runs and is fun so...

I am a programmer, and I'm going to be an engineer.
